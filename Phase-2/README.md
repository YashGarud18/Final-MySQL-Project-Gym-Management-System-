## 🔄 Queries Implemented

## 1. DDL (Data Definition Language)

Creating tables for users, memberships, classes, payments, and more.

Altering tables to add or rename columns.

Setting up foreign key constraints.

Dropping tables or columns when necessary.

## 2. DML (Data Manipulation Language)

Updating records to reflect new information.

Deleting specific records or clearing tables.

## 3. DQL (Data Query Language)

Selecting all records from tables.

Filtering data with conditions.

Aggregating data (COUNT, SUM, AVG).

Ordering and grouping data.

## 4. Joins & Subqueries

Inner and outer joins to combine data across tables.

Subqueries to handle complex queries, like finding users with the highest payments.

## 5. Operators, Clauses, Aliases, and Functions

Using operators (>, <, =, LIKE) to filter data.

Applying clauses (ORDER BY, GROUP BY, HAVING) for data presentation.

Utilizing aliases to rename fields.

Implementing functions like CONCAT, AVG, and ROUND.

## 6. Cascades

Ensured referential integrity with ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE.

## 📖 How to Use

Import the provided SQL script into your favorite SQL database.

Run the DDL queries to create the necessary tables.

Populate tables with sample data using the DML queries.

Execute DQL queries to view and analyze the data.

## 🔍 Future Enhancements
